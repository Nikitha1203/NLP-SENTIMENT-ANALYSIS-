# NLP-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-

## Introduction

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. The goal of this project is to develop a tool that can analyze the sentiment of text data and provide valuable insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Sentiment140" dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment (positive or negative). You can find the dataset [here](insert_dataset_link_here). The dataset was preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.

## Installation

Features
Analyze sentiment of text data.
Visualize sentiment scores.
Export sentiment analysis results.
Results
The sentiment analysis results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset. The visualizations included in the project illustrate the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
